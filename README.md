# Conference Session Database

The Conference Session Database is built using Oracle 12c database for data storage and management, with SQL for querying and manipulating data.

This database is designed to track contacts, invitations, registrations, hotel bookings, and flight arrangements for conference attendees. 

Built using an Oracle database, it consists of several tables:

* Contacts: Stores information about attendees, including their names, organizations, titles, and contact details.
* Invitations: Tracks the invitation status sent to each contact.
* Registration: Manages registration status, indicating whether attendees have completed their registration.
* Hotel Bookings: Records hotel booking details for attendees, including check-in and check-out dates and associated costs.
* Flights: Keeps flight details for attendees, including flight numbers, arrival, and departure dates.
* Session Attendance: Monitors attendance status for each session.
* 
This system allows for easy querying of attendee status, management of logistics, and efficient tracking of expenses related to hotel and flight bookings.
